# Pyber-Rideshare



## Analysis

- The urban category has a high volume of total fares, drivers, and total number of rides across the board, but as for rural cities, it is significantly low compared to each other. One can assume the demand is higher in high traffic areas and therefore is met with the demand to satisfy the need for rideshare service.

- In suburban areas, the percentage of total fares by city is only half of the total amount of Urban fares (30.5% compared to 62.7%), one possible factor could be the distance from the outskirts of urban areas for leisure or work purposes and other miscellaneous trips. Rural is a bit increased as well because of the distance it must make up for, but one can assume that there isnâ€™t much demand in rural areas, so the percentage would still be lower compared to other categories.

- In conclusion, where there is a demand to be met in suburban areas compared to a densely populated area, the results are immensely different. Distance can also play a role in higher fares but that might also discourage the total of rides in that certain area for future trips; so this could be another experiment worth looking into by implementing a survey to those that live in rural areas compared to urban and suburban.
